Certainly! Here are concise answers to questions #1-10:

---

### **SQL Fundamentals**

**1. Explain the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN with examples.**
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns only matching rows from both tables.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;
  ```
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table; non-matching rows have NULLs.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM A LEFT JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;
  ```
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table; non-matching rows have NULLs.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM A RIGHT JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;
  ```
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns all rows when there is a match in either table; non-matching rows have NULLs (not natively supported in MySQL but can be emulated).

---

**2. What's the difference between UNION and UNION ALL? When would you use each?**
- **UNION**: Combines results of two queries, removing duplicates.
- **UNION ALL**: Combines results without removing duplicates.
- Use **UNION** when duplicate rows are not allowed; use **UNION ALL** for better performance when duplicates are acceptable.

---

**3. Explain the order of execution in an SQL query (FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, SELECT, ORDER BY).**
1. **FROM**: Identifies the source tables.
2. **WHERE**: Filters rows based on conditions.
3. **GROUP BY**: Groups rows for aggregation.
4. **HAVING**: Filters groups based on conditions.
5. **SELECT**: Selects columns and applies expressions.
6. **ORDER BY**: Sorts the final result set.

---

**4. What is the difference between a PRIMARY KEY and a UNIQUE constraint?**
- **PRIMARY KEY**: Uniquely identifies each row; cannot contain NULLs; only one per table.
- **UNIQUE**: Ensures column values are unique; allows NULLs; multiple constraints per table.

---

**5. Explain how to use subqueries and when to use them instead of joins.**
- **Subquery**: A query nested inside another query. Example:
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department_id IN (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE location = 'NY');
  ```
- Use subqueries for filtering or calculations when the logic is self-contained. Use joins for combining data from multiple tables.

---

### **MySQL Specific Features**

**6. What are the different storage engines in MySQL and when would you use each one?**
- **InnoDB**: Default engine; supports transactions, foreign keys, and row-level locking (use for OLTP workloads).
- **MyISAM**: Fast read-heavy operations; no transaction support (use for read-only or analytics workloads).
- **Memory**: Stores data in RAM; fast but volatile (use for temporary tables).
- **Archive**: Optimized for storing large amounts of historical data.

---

**7. Explain the importance of the InnoDB storage engine and its features compared to MyISAM.**
- **InnoDB**: Supports ACID transactions, foreign keys, row-level locking, and crash recovery.
- **MyISAM**: Faster for reads but lacks transaction support and uses table-level locking.

---

**8. How do you optimize a slow MySQL query? Walk through your approach.**
1. Analyze the query using `EXPLAIN`.
2. Add appropriate indexes (e.g., covering indexes).
3. Avoid `SELECT *` and fetch only required columns.
4. Optimize joins and avoid correlated subqueries.
5. Use caching mechanisms like query cache (if applicable).

---

**9. Describe MySQL's query cache. When is it useful and when might it cause problems?**
- **Query Cache**: Caches the result of SELECT queries for reuse.
- **Useful**: For static data with frequent identical queries.
- **Problems**: Causes contention in high-write environments due to invalidation overhead.

---

**10. How do you implement and use stored procedures in MySQL?**
- Stored procedures are precompiled SQL code blocks stored in the database.
- Example:
  ```sql
  DELIMITER //
  CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeCount()
  BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
  END //
  DELIMITER ;
  CALL GetEmployeeCount();
  ```

Certainly! Here are concise answers to questions #11-20:

---

### **Indexing and Performance**

**11. Explain different types of indexes in MySQL and when to use each.**
- **Primary Key Index**: Ensures uniqueness and identifies rows; use for the main identifier.
- **Unique Index**: Enforces uniqueness on non-primary key columns.
- **Composite Index**: Covers multiple columns; use for queries filtering on multiple fields.
- **Full-Text Index**: Optimized for text search; use for `LIKE` or `MATCH` queries.
- **B-Tree Index**: Default; good for range queries and sorting.

---

**12. What is a covering index and how does it improve query performance?**
- A **covering index** includes all columns needed by a query, eliminating the need to access the table data.
- Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_covering ON employees (department_id, salary);
  SELECT department_id, salary FROM employees WHERE department_id = 5;
  ```
- Improves performance by reducing I/O operations.

---

**13. How do you identify and resolve index fragmentation in MySQL?**
- **Identify**: Use `ANALYZE TABLE` or check index statistics.
- **Resolve**: Rebuild the index using `OPTIMIZE TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE ... ENGINE=InnoDB`.

---

**14. Explain the concept of cardinality in MySQL indexes and why it matters.**
- **Cardinality**: The number of unique values in a column.
- High cardinality improves index efficiency because it reduces duplicate entries, making lookups faster.

---

**15. What are the tradeoffs of adding too many indexes to a table?**
- **Pros**: Faster read queries.
- **Cons**: Slower write operations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) due to index maintenance overhead; increased storage usage.

---

### **Data Modeling and Schema Design**

**16. How would you design a database schema for a social media application?**
- Core tables: `users`, `posts`, `comments`, `likes`, `followers`.
- Relationships:
  - `users` → `posts` (1:N)
  - `posts` → `comments` (1:N)
  - `users` ↔ `followers` (M:N via a join table).
- Normalize to reduce redundancy; denormalize selectively for performance.

---

**17. Explain normalization and denormalization. When would you choose one over the other?**
- **Normalization**: Reduces redundancy by organizing data into related tables (e.g., 1NF, 2NF, 3NF).
- **Denormalization**: Combines tables to optimize read-heavy workloads.
- Use normalization for transactional systems; denormalization for analytics or high-read applications.

---

**18. What are the pros and cons of using surrogate keys vs. natural keys?**
- **Surrogate Keys**:
  - Pros: Simple, stable, avoids business logic changes.
  - Cons: Adds an extra column; no inherent meaning.
- **Natural Keys**:
  - Pros: Meaningful and avoids extra columns.
  - Cons: Prone to changes; may not be unique or stable.

---

**19. How do you handle schema changes in a production MySQL database?**
- Use tools like **Liquibase** or **Flyway** for versioned migrations.
- Apply changes during low-traffic periods.
- Test changes in staging before production.
- Use `ALTER TABLE` with care; consider creating a new table and migrating data for large changes.

---

**20. Explain star schema vs. snowflake schema in data warehouse design.**
- **Star Schema**: Central fact table connected to dimension tables; simple and fast for queries.
- **Snowflake Schema**: Normalized dimensions; reduces redundancy but increases query complexity.

Great! Here are concise answers to questions #21-30:

---

### **Transactions and Concurrency**

**21. Explain ACID properties in the context of MySQL transactions.**
- **Atomicity**: Ensures all operations in a transaction succeed or fail as a unit.
- **Consistency**: Maintains data integrity by enforcing rules (e.g., constraints).
- **Isolation**: Transactions operate independently; changes are not visible until committed.
- **Durability**: Committed changes persist even after a system crash.

---

**22. What isolation levels are available in MySQL and when would you use each?**
- **READ UNCOMMITTED**: Allows dirty reads; fastest but least safe.
- **READ COMMITTED**: Prevents dirty reads; allows non-repeatable reads.
- **REPEATABLE READ** (default): Prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads; may cause phantom reads.
- **SERIALIZABLE**: Strictest; prevents all anomalies but has the highest locking overhead.
- Use based on trade-offs between consistency and performance.

---

**23. How do you handle deadlocks in MySQL? How can you prevent them?**
- **Handle**: MySQL automatically detects and rolls back one transaction.
- **Prevent**:
  - Access tables in a consistent order.
  - Keep transactions short.
  - Use lower isolation levels where possible.

---

**24. Explain optimistic vs. pessimistic locking in MySQL.**
- **Optimistic Locking**: Assumes conflicts are rare; checks for conflicts at commit time (e.g., using version numbers).
- **Pessimistic Locking**: Assumes conflicts are likely; locks rows explicitly (e.g., `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`).

---

**25. What is row-level locking in InnoDB and how does it differ from table-level locking?**
- **Row-Level Locking**: Locks only affected rows; minimizes contention.
- **Table-Level Locking**: Locks the entire table; simpler but less concurrent.
- InnoDB uses row-level locking for better concurrency.

---

### **Functions and Advanced SQL**

    ```
  - Summarize data (e.g., total sales by region).

---

**33. What's the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP statements?**
- **DELETE**: Removes specific rows based on a condition; logs each row deletion.
- **TRUNCATE**: Removes all rows in a table; faster and resets auto-increment counters.
- **DROP**: Deletes the entire table structure and data.

---

**34. How would you find and remove duplicate records in MySQL?**
- Identify duplicates:
  ```sql
  SELECT id, COUNT(*) 
  FROM table_name 
  GROUP BY id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
  ```
- Remove duplicates:

These answers focus on practical strategies and key concepts. Let me know if you need further clarification or additional details on any topic!


Yes, **MySQL supports Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** starting from version **8.0**. CTEs allow you to create temporary result sets that can be referenced within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. They improve query readability and simplify complex queries by breaking them into logical parts.

### Syntax:
```sql
WITH cte_name (column_list) AS (
    -- Define the CTE query
    SELECT ...
)
-- Use the CTE in a main query
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

### Example of a Simple CTE:
```sql
WITH employee_salaries AS (
    SELECT id, name, salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE department = 'Engineering'
)
SELECT name, salary
FROM employee_salaries
WHERE salary > 70000;
```

### Recursive CTE:
MySQL also supports **recursive CTEs**, which are useful for hierarchical or iterative data (e.g., organizational charts, tree structures).

#### Example of a Recursive CTE:
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE number_series AS (
    -- Anchor member: Start with 1
    SELECT 1 AS n
    UNION ALL
    -- Recursive member: Increment by 1
    SELECT n + 1 FROM number_series WHERE n < 10
)
SELECT * FROM number_series;
```

### Key Points:
1. **Non-Recursive CTEs**: Simplify complex queries by breaking them into smaller, reusable parts.
2. **Recursive CTEs**: Allow you to work with hierarchical or iterative data structures.
3. **Temporary Scope**: The CTE exists only for the duration of the query in which it is defined.

### Benefits of CTEs:
- Improve query readability and maintainability.
- Avoid repetitive subqueries.
- Enable recursion for hierarchical data.

If you're using MySQL 8.0 or later, you can take full advantage of CTEs! However, if you're on an older version (e.g., MySQL 5.x), CTEs are not supported, and you would need to use subqueries or temporary tables instead.



Here are **5 favorite SQL-related questions** focused on using **Presto** to process big data. These questions are designed to test both theoretical understanding and practical application of Presto in a big data environment:

---

### **1. How does Presto differ from traditional relational databases when querying large datasets?**
- **Key Concept**: Presto is a distributed SQL query engine designed for querying large-scale data stored in various formats (e.g., HDFS, S3, Kafka) without loading it into a single database.
- **Answer**:
  - Presto is not a database but a query engine that processes data in-place across distributed storage systems.
  - It supports ANSI SQL and can query data from multiple sources (e.g., Hive, MySQL, Cassandra) in a single query.
  - Unlike traditional databases, Presto doesn’t store data itself; it reads data directly from storage systems like HDFS or cloud storage.

---

### **2. How do you optimize a Presto query for better performance when processing large datasets?**
- **Key Concept**: Presto performance depends on efficient resource utilization, partitioning, and minimizing data movement.
- **Answer**:
  - Use **partition pruning**: Query only relevant partitions by filtering on partition columns.
  - Optimize file formats: Use columnar formats like **Parquet** or **ORC** for faster scans.
  - Increase parallelism: Adjust `task.concurrency` and `node-scheduler.max-splits-per-node` settings.
  - Avoid `SELECT *`: Fetch only required columns to reduce I/O overhead.
  - Use bucketing for joins: Pre-bucketed data reduces shuffle overhead during join operations.

---

### **3. Write a Presto SQL query to calculate the total sales per region from a large dataset stored in Hive.**
- **Key Concept**: Presto integrates seamlessly with Hive and can query Hive tables directly.
- **Answer**:
```sql
SELECT 
    region, 
    SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM hive.default.sales_data
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```
- Explanation:
  - The `hive.default.sales_data` table resides in Hive's metastore.
  - Presto reads the data in parallel and aggregates it using `SUM` and `GROUP BY`.

---

### **4. How does Presto handle joins on large datasets, and what strategies can you use to optimize them?**
- **Key Concept**: Presto uses distributed processing for joins, which can be resource-intensive for large datasets.
- **Answer**:
  - **Broadcast Join**: For small-to-medium-sized tables, Presto broadcasts one table to all nodes.
  - **Partitioned Join**: For large tables, Presto partitions both datasets and performs the join locally on each worker node.
  - Optimization Strategies:
    - Use bucketing or pre-partitioning to reduce shuffle overhead.
    - Ensure join keys are indexed or sorted.
    - Filter data before joining to reduce the dataset size.

---

### **5. How would you use Presto to query semi-structured data (e.g., JSON) stored in Amazon S3?**
- **Key Concept**: Presto supports querying semi-structured data formats like JSON using functions to extract nested fields.
- **Answer**:
```sql
SELECT 
    id, 
    json_extract_scalar(metadata, '$.event_type') AS event_type,
    CAST(json_extract_scalar(metadata, '$.timestamp') AS TIMESTAMP) AS event_time
FROM s3.default.events_json
WHERE json_extract_scalar(metadata, '$.event_type') = 'click';
```
- Explanation:
  - The `s3.default.events_json` table points to JSON files in an S3 bucket.
  - Presto uses `json_extract_scalar` to extract specific fields from JSON objects.
  - The `CAST` function converts extracted values into appropriate data types.

---

### Why These Questions?
These questions cover:
1. **Fundamental differences** between Presto and traditional databases.
2. **Performance optimization**, a critical aspect of working with big data.
3. **Practical SQL examples** for common tasks like aggregation and semi-structured data processing.
4. **Join strategies**, which are essential for handling large datasets efficiently.
5. **Integration with external systems** like Hive and S3, showcasing Presto’s versatility.
