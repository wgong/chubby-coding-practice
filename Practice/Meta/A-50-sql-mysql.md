### **SQL Fundamentals**

**1. Explain the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN with examples.**
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns only matching rows from both tables.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;
  ```
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table; non-matching rows have NULLs.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM A LEFT JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;
  ```
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table; non-matching rows have NULLs.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM A RIGHT JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;
  ```
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns all rows when there is a match in either table; non-matching rows have NULLs (not natively supported in MySQL but can be emulated).

---

**2. What's the difference between UNION and UNION ALL? When would you use each?**
- **UNION**: Combines results of two queries, removing duplicates.
- **UNION ALL**: Combines results without removing duplicates.
- Use **UNION** when duplicate rows are not allowed; use **UNION ALL** for better performance when duplicates are acceptable.

---

**3. Explain the order of execution in an SQL query (FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, SELECT, ORDER BY).**
1. **FROM**: Identifies the source tables.
2. **WHERE**: Filters rows based on conditions.
3. **GROUP BY**: Groups rows for aggregation.
4. **HAVING**: Filters groups based on conditions.
5. **SELECT**: Selects columns and applies expressions.
6. **ORDER BY**: Sorts the final result set.

---

**4. What is the difference between a PRIMARY KEY and a UNIQUE constraint?**
- **PRIMARY KEY**: Uniquely identifies each row; cannot contain NULLs; only one per table.
- **UNIQUE**: Ensures column values are unique; allows NULLs; multiple constraints per table.

---

**5. Explain how to use subqueries and when to use them instead of joins.**
- **Subquery**: A query nested inside another query. Example:
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department_id IN (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE location = 'NY');
  ```
- Use subqueries for filtering or calculations when the logic is self-contained. Use joins for combining data from multiple tables.

---

### **MySQL Specific Features**

**6. What are the different storage engines in MySQL and when would you use each one?**
- **InnoDB**: Default engine; supports transactions, foreign keys, and row-level locking (use for OLTP workloads).
- **MyISAM**: Fast read-heavy operations; no transaction support (use for read-only or analytics workloads).
- **Memory**: Stores data in RAM; fast but volatile (use for temporary tables).
- **Archive**: Optimized for storing large amounts of historical data.

---

**7. Explain the importance of the InnoDB storage engine and its features compared to MyISAM.**
- **InnoDB**: Supports ACID transactions, foreign keys, row-level locking, and crash recovery.
- **MyISAM**: Faster for reads but lacks transaction support and uses table-level locking.

---

**8. How do you optimize a slow MySQL query? Walk through your approach.**
1. Analyze the query using `EXPLAIN`.
2. Add appropriate indexes (e.g., covering indexes).
3. Avoid `SELECT *` and fetch only required columns.
4. Optimize joins and avoid correlated subqueries.
5. Use caching mechanisms like query cache (if applicable).

---

**9. Describe MySQL's query cache. When is it useful and when might it cause problems?**
- **Query Cache**: Caches the result of SELECT queries for reuse.
- **Useful**: For static data with frequent identical queries.
- **Problems**: Causes contention in high-write environments due to invalidation overhead.

---

**10. How do you implement and use stored procedures in MySQL?**
- Stored procedures are precompiled SQL code blocks stored in the database.
- Example:
  ```sql
  DELIMITER //
  CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeCount()
  BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
  END //
  DELIMITER ;
  CALL GetEmployeeCount();
  ```

---

### **Indexing and Performance**

**11. Explain different types of indexes in MySQL and when to use each.**
- **Primary Key Index**: Ensures uniqueness and identifies rows; use for the main identifier.
- **Unique Index**: Enforces uniqueness on non-primary key columns.
- **Composite Index**: Covers multiple columns; use for queries filtering on multiple fields.
- **Full-Text Index**: Optimized for text search; use for `LIKE` or `MATCH` queries.
- **B-Tree Index**: Default; good for range queries and sorting.

---

**12. What is a covering index and how does it improve query performance?**
- A **covering index** includes all columns needed by a query, eliminating the need to access the table data.
- Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_covering ON employees (department_id, salary);
  SELECT department_id, salary FROM employees WHERE department_id = 5;
  ```
- Improves performance by reducing I/O operations.

---

**13. How do you identify and resolve index fragmentation in MySQL?**
- **Identify**: Use `ANALYZE TABLE` or check index statistics.
- **Resolve**: Rebuild the index using `OPTIMIZE TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE ... ENGINE=InnoDB`.

---

**14. Explain the concept of cardinality in MySQL indexes and why it matters.**
- **Cardinality**: The number of unique values in a column.
- High cardinality improves index efficiency because it reduces duplicate entries, making lookups faster.

---

**15. What are the tradeoffs of adding too many indexes to a table?**
- **Pros**: Faster read queries.
- **Cons**: Slower write operations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) due to index maintenance overhead; increased storage usage.

---

### **Data Modeling and Schema Design**

**16. How would you design a database schema for a social media application?**
- Core tables: `users`, `posts`, `comments`, `likes`, `followers`.
- Relationships:
  - `users` → `posts` (1:N)
  - `posts` → `comments` (1:N)
  - `users` ↔ `followers` (M:N via a join table).
- Normalize to reduce redundancy; denormalize selectively for performance.

---

**17. Explain normalization and denormalization. When would you choose one over the other?**
- **Normalization**: Reduces redundancy by organizing data into related tables (e.g., 1NF, 2NF, 3NF).
- **Denormalization**: Combines tables to optimize read-heavy workloads.
- Use normalization for transactional systems; denormalization for analytics or high-read applications.

---

**18. What are the pros and cons of using surrogate keys vs. natural keys?**
- **Surrogate Keys**:
  - Pros: Simple, stable, avoids business logic changes.
  - Cons: Adds an extra column; no inherent meaning.
- **Natural Keys**:
  - Pros: Meaningful and avoids extra columns.
  - Cons: Prone to changes; may not be unique or stable.

---

**19. How do you handle schema changes in a production MySQL database?**
- Use tools like **Liquibase** or **Flyway** for versioned migrations.
- Apply changes during low-traffic periods.
- Test changes in staging before production.
- Use `ALTER TABLE` with care; consider creating a new table and migrating data for large changes.

---

**20. Explain star schema vs. snowflake schema in data warehouse design.**
- **Star Schema**: Central fact table connected to dimension tables; simple and fast for queries.
- **Snowflake Schema**: Normalized dimensions; reduces redundancy but increases query complexity.

---

### **Transactions and Concurrency**

**21. Explain ACID properties in the context of MySQL transactions.**
- **Atomicity**: Ensures all operations in a transaction succeed or fail as a unit.
- **Consistency**: Maintains data integrity by enforcing rules (e.g., constraints).
- **Isolation**: Transactions operate independently; changes are not visible until committed.
- **Durability**: Committed changes persist even after a system crash.

---

**22. What isolation levels are available in MySQL and when would you use each?**
- **READ UNCOMMITTED**: Allows dirty reads; fastest but least safe.
- **READ COMMITTED**: Prevents dirty reads; allows non-repeatable reads.
- **REPEATABLE READ** (default): Prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads; may cause phantom reads.
- **SERIALIZABLE**: Strictest; prevents all anomalies but has the highest locking overhead.
- Use based on trade-offs between consistency and performance.

---

**23. How do you handle deadlocks in MySQL? How can you prevent them?**
- **Handle**: MySQL automatically detects and rolls back one transaction.
- **Prevent**:
  - Access tables in a consistent order.
  - Keep transactions short.
  - Use lower isolation levels where possible.

---

**24. Explain optimistic vs. pessimistic locking in MySQL.**
- **Optimistic Locking**: Assumes conflicts are rare; checks for conflicts at commit time (e.g., using version numbers).
- **Pessimistic Locking**: Assumes conflicts are likely; locks rows explicitly (e.g., `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`).

---

**25. What is row-level locking in InnoDB and how does it differ from table-level locking?**
- **Row-Level Locking**: Locks only affected rows; minimizes contention.
- **Table-Level Locking**: Locks the entire table; simpler but less concurrent.
- InnoDB uses row-level locking for better concurrency.

---

    name, 
    salary,
    CASE 
      WHEN salary < 50000 THEN 'Low'
      WHEN salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000 THEN 'Medium'
      ELSE 'High'
    END AS salary_category
  FROM employees;
  ```
